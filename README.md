# Tensorflow-Keras-AI-stocks-risk-management-tool

This advanced program utilizes the latest in artificial intelligence technology, including Keras and TensorFlow, to create a cutting-edge stock market prediction system. The program trains on vast amounts of historical stock data from 17 of the largest exchanges worldwide, leveraging the power of GPU acceleration to quickly and efficiently process the data.

Once the data has been thoroughly analyzed and the model has been trained, the program samples and resamples the data to ensure the accuracy of its predictions. This process helps to identify patterns and trends in the stock market, providing valuable insights for investors.

The program uses Flask to connect to a local server, where it outputs data based on statistical probabilities of an asset going up or down in real-time. This information can then be used to manage a portfolio on various timeframes, from minute to daily, by sending GET commands to the MetaTrader suite.

Whether you are a seasoned trader or just starting out, this program offers a comprehensive and automated solution for stock market investment. By analyzing vast amounts of data and making real-time predictions, it helps to minimize risk and maximize profits
